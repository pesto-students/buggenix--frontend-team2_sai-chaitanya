# Buggenix

BuggenixÂ is a one-stop software tool that scrapes any issues/bugs/feature requests reported by your fellow customers from any social media/communication channel that you could have your presence in, ranging from LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, email, Instagram to your everyday. Our proprietary algorithm efficiently separates the wheat from the chaff, meaning, it efficiently filters out grievances and bugs from neutral, everyday messages/tweets that you might receive on your socials, effectively helping you stay on top of customer grievances, getting your developers working on it ASAP and keeping your product's UX the best that it can be!

Apart from being the extremely adept bug scouter, it also makes your life convenient by converting those bugs into tickets automatically that your team can get started on resolving with just a few clicks. As a Buggenix admin, you can set priorities for created tickets, create your own tickets, add them to a project, assign them to developers, view metrics and more such features with our beautifully crafted UI.

## Technology stack

We tried to use a completely modern tech stack while testing out some new technologies that we had never used before. This resulted in a fast, performant, and easily-extensible web app that should be fairly future-proof for the coming next several years. We used:

  - React
  - Redux
  - NodeJs
  - ExpressJs
  - MongoDB
  - Okta
  - Redux toolkit
